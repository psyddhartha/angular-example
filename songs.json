        "albumDesc": "As humanity declared 2015 the year of light (The light deception), may CERN turned on it's magnetic disruptor and again they tried to split reality (dimensions), the powers to be are now being questioned for their actions on our Earth (Gaia), so in 2016 humanity has began to be known as the year of self- truths and the world agenda program. We are faced with the cross road, a freedom of choice and awarity to a more sustainable soicety or a biometric controlled matrix which will feed on the sentient life force (light) we call humanity. It is a choice for us to see the agenda or to play ignorance while the development of AI is to create any reality you wish in a false light projection (matrix). You alone have the choice to consciously explore your illusion to truly manifest a reality which serves the whole instead the self, this is the true path of the light. Deception comes in forms unnatural to our purpose to prosper and evolve, while technology holds many answers, it will not help the human light to expand to the next energetic vibration, but can allow the parasite mind to attatch to the addiction to enslave, as false light. This Audio visual package is the data code to tap into the subconsious mind and help to open the paradigm of this cross road we face, in so we would like to present to you DarkWhisper's latest album (RealmsOfUnseen) and a piece of art named: The Looking Glass - a self projection in the activation of our collective purpose or the matrix hive mind. The Audio package is a development of stories and messages to help the listener to remember the memories we all hold in our DNA (fractal torus in light speed memory). While opening the questions we are taught in our contemporary reality. We hope you will find this package not just a trinket, but a message away from words with motives, a story that may help you on the quest of self-truth and memory discovery."
